In an election with more than two candidates, it is often the case that
the winner (the candidate receiving the most votes) receives less than
the majority of the votes.  Given the results of an election, can you
determine the winner, and whether the winner received more than half
of the votes?

\section*{Input}
The first line of input contains a single positive integer $T \leq
500$ indicating the number of test cases. The first line of each test
case also contains a single positive integer $n$ indicating the number
of candidates in the election.  This is followed by $n$ lines, with
the $i$th line containing a single nonnegative integer indicating the
number of votes candidate $i$ received.

There are at least $2$ and no more than $10$ candidates in each case, and
each candidate will not receive more than $50\,000$ votes.  There will be
at least one vote cast in each election.

\section*{Output}

Provide a line of output for each test case.  If the winner receives
more than half of the votes, print the phrase \verb|majority winner|
followed by the candidate number of the winner.  If the winner does
not receive more than half of the votes, print the phrase
\verb|minority winner| followed by the candidate number of the winner.
If a winner cannot be determined because no single candidate has more
vote than others, print the phrase \verb|no winner|.  The candidate 
numbers in each case are $1, 2, \ldots, n$.
