Alice travels a lot for her work. Each time she travels, she visits a single
city before returning home.

Someone recently asked her ``how many different cities have you visited for
work?'' Thankfully Alice has kept a log of her trips. Help Alice figure
out the number of cities she has visited at least once.

\section*{Input}
The first line of input contains a single positive integer $T \leq 50$ indicating
the number of test cases. The first line of each test case also contains
a single positive integer $n$ indicating the number of work trips Alice has taken
so far. The following $n$ lines describe these trips.
The $i$th such line simply contains the name of the city Alice
visited on her $i$th trip.

Alice's work only sends her to cities with {\em simple} names:
city names only contain lowercase letters, have at least one letter,
and do not contain spaces.

The number of trips is at most $100$ and no city name contains more than $20$
characters.

\section*{Output}
For each test case, simply output a single line containing a single
integer that is the number of distinct cities that Alice has visited
on her work trips.
